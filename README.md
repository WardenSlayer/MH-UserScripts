# üêÅMH-Userscripts
This is a repository of userscripts for the game [MouseHunt.](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/) I started this project with a personal goal to learn JavaScript and to create tools to enhance the experience of other mouse hunters who also share my passion for the game. This repository was created to allow others to join in on the learning together experience and to suggest new features. If you want to join the community, fork and "Let's do it!"

In order to use these scripts, you must be playing on [MHG.com](https://www.mousehuntgame.com) and you must have the browser extension [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) installed. It works well on PCs in most modern web browsers. If you want to use them on a mobile device, you must use a browser that supports userscripts.
 - Android: [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=kiwi%20browser&c=apps&hl=en)
- iOS Safari with an [Userscript App](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/macaque/id1595306197)

Once you have the browser extension ready, head on over to my [github page](https://wardenslayer.github.io/Mousehunt-UserScripts/) where you will find links to [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/227259-warden-slayer) where you can hit the big green "Install" button to load the scripts individually.  

If you need any help setting things up or want to share ideas/feedback on my scripts, [find me on Discord](https://discord.com/users/341669842736119818) or shoot me an email at [Dev.WardenSlayer@gmail.com](mailto:Dev.WardenSlayer@gmail.com)
