# üë®‚ÄçüíªHow to Contribute üë©‚Äçüíª
If you want to contribute with code/documentation [fork this repositry](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and edit the code on your local machine. Please put you changes on a new branch. It would be cleanest if you only made edits to one script at a time so I only have to test one thing before merging your changes into the main branch.

**There are a couple of ways you can develop and test your userscript code.**
 1. Make your changes in the  built in Tempermonkey Editor on the dashboard. Then copy you finished code  back into the repo folder to commit [Easiest]. 
 2. Use this [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey-editors/lieodnapokbjkkdkhdljlllmgkmdokcm/related) to use a VSCode instance to make your changes to the tampermonkey code.  
 3. You can edit the code in your favorite IDE on your computer by setting up access to your [local file system like this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41212558/develop-tampermonkey-scripts-in-a-real-ide-with-automatic-deployment-to-openuser).

**Some Technical Notes**
The scripts all auto update to GreasyFork when the code is update and in order for GreasyFork to know there is a new version, the version number in the script itself must increase. You must include that in your pull request.

Thanks so much for your interest in contributing. My contact information is in [the README](https://github.com/WardenSlayer/Mousehunt-UserScripts/blob/documentation/README.md) if you have any questions.
